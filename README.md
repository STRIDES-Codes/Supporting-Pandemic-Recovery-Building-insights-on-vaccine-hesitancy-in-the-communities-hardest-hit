## Inequitable Impacts
In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic traveled quickly and swiftly, infecting individuals throughout the world without consideration for borders, race, or socioeconomic status; however, throughout the pandemic it has become clear that the virus has not affected all individuals equally. Particularly in the US, grave health disparities have been highlighted but the pandemic with low-income communities and communities of color often experiencing higher rates of severe symptoms, hospitalization, and death due to the disease. Furthermore, we have also seen gaps in vaccine accessibility and demographic patterns in vaccine hesitancy. 

##Our Approach
Our research will investigate and compare social determinants of COVID-19 severity across communities in the United States with predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Our approach will utilize machine learning models to predict likelihood of vaccine hesitancy and likelihood of COVID-19 severity. Then, we will extract feature importance from the most successful models to determine the factors most likely to be correlated with both COVID infection rates, and vaccine hesitancy. Finally, we will compare these findings in an interactive dashboard, using data visualization methods such as choropleths or heat maps.
